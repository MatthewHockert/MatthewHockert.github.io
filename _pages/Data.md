# St. Paul Police Districts
I’m currently working on a paper examining the effect of rent control on crime in St. Paul and needed a shapefile of the city’s police districts. Since I wasn’t able to locate an official version, I created my own using QGIS. I’ve attached the data for your reference.

You can download the shapefile below:
