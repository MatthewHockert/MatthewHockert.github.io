Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD student at the [University of Minnesota Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu) studying Urban Economics related to labor, transportation, and housing.  I am a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) with the [Accessibility Observatory](https://www.cts.umn.edu/programs/ao) and Hennepin County, where I study the impact of conservation easements on property values and municipal taxes. Previously, I worked as a Data Science Intern at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org) for two and a half years. During my time there, I contributed to various projects, including analyzing the effects of Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) on banksâ€™ reserves and collaborating with the stress testing team. My responsibilities included enhancing their forecasting model with Kalman Filtering and Smoothing techniques.. This website is a platform where I will share my professional work, projects, research, thoughts, etc.

The site is always under construction as I add additional sections such as my publications, portfolio, blog posts, CV, etc. Check back soon as it will reflect my personal and professional journey.

Thank you for visiting, and please check back soon for updates!
