Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD student at the [University of Minnesota Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu) studying Urban Economics related to labor, transportation, and housing.  I am a Graduate Research Assistant with the [Accessibility Observatory](https://www.cts.umn.edu/programs/ao) and a [Data Science Intern](https://www.minneapolisfed.org) at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. This website is a platform where I will share my professional work, projects, research, thoughts, etc.

Currently, the site is under construction, but soon it will feature sections on my publications, portfolio, blog posts, CV, etc. Check back soon as it will reflect my personal and professional journey.

Thank you for visiting, and please check back soon for updates!
