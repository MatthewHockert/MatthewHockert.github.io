* **Email**: [matthew.hockert@gmail.com](mailto:matthew.hockert@gmail.com)
* **LinkedIn**: [linkedin.com/in/matthewhockert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhockert/)

# Education
* **PhD in Applied Economics**, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, Expected 2022 - Present
  * Coursework: Applied Microeconomic Sequence, Ph.D. Econometrics Sequence, Programming
    for Econometrics, Big Data Methods in Economics, Introduction to Machine Learning,
    Principles of Database Systems.
  * Classroom experience with econometrics and machine learning:
  * Built machine learning models including perceptron algorithm, decision trees, and Nearest
    neighbors (KNN) using Python in 'Introduction to Machine Learning'.
  * Applied and evaluated causal inference techniques in econometric modeling, utilizing R to
    construct and test various models as part of the 'Ph.D. Econometrics Sequence' course.
  * Implemented machine learning packages in python as well as text and web scraping
    analysis in R as part of 'Big Data Methods' and 'Programming for Econometrics' courses.
* **MS in Applied Economics**, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 2020 - 2022
  * Graduate minor: Data Science.
  * Thesis: A Spatial Approach to Agrifood Supply Chain Structure.
  * Examined the structural dynamics of U.S. agrifood supply chains during COVID•19, using
    spatial regression models to measure the effect of food capacity on food flows at county
    levels across the supply chain.
  * Utilized various datasets, including IMPLAN and Census data, to develop spatial regression
    models, which captured movements of goods through the supply chain.
  * Generated results about the impact of adjacent supply chain segments on regional
    coefficients, providing insights into the potential fragility or resilience of the supply chains.
  * Chosen to be a Selected Paper Presenter at AAEA.
* **BA in Economics and Political Science**, University of Minnesota Duluth, 2017 - 2020
  * Graduated with honors.
  * GPA: 3.7/4.0
  * Honors: University Honors Program, Dean's List, Cum Laude, Economic Department Honors,
    Omicron Delta Epsilon.

# Research Experience
* **Data Science Intern**, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, June 2022 - Present
  * Assisting the production team in Stress Testing to convert code from MATLAB to R to build
    forecasting models for assessing bank resiliency against various macroeconomic shocks.
  * Analyzed data of U.S. banking conditions under the new CECL guidelines and presented
    findings to examiners and supervisors.
  * Created Rshiny applications providing analytics and incorporating risk models to identify bank
    risk levels by loan and asset types.
  * Investigated changes in rural banking quality and agricultural output in the Ninth District.
  * Created Rshiny dashboard displaying differences in counties’ economies and banking
  conditions.
* **Graduate Research Assistant**, Accessibility Observatory, Sept 2022 - Present
  * Created public datasets on accessibility of transportation types (bike, car, and transit) using
    Pandas and SQL.
  * Developed Python pipeline taking data from DBeaver, cleaning it, and generated weighted
    average data of jobs accessible from block group to state level within the US.
  * Created Rshiny application using leaflet package to display job accessibility nationally from
    block group to state level.
  * Experience using GIT in UNIX environment.
  * Familiarity with SQL within Dbeaver and Python pipeline.
* **Graduate Research Assistant**, University of Minnesota, Sept 2020 - 2022
  * Conducted literature review for future publication.
  * Examined regional food system resiliency during the COVID•19 Pandemic.
  * Built comprehensive dataset using Census and IMPLAN data for OLS and spatial regression
    models in R.
* **Undergraduate Research Assistant**, Bureau of Business and Economic Research, Duluth, MN, Sept 2019 - May 2020
  • Generated local economic data and performed data analysis on IMPLAN, Excel, and SPSS.
  • Cleaned and interpreted survey data on Qualtrics and Excel.
  • Worked with fellow research assistants to write publications that were later published on the
    university website.
  • Helped in crafting literature review and public outreach for labor market research.
