## Education
* **PhD in Applied Economics**, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, September 2022 – Present  
  * Fourth year PhD student during 2025–2026 school year.  
  * Research Fields: land use, housing, transportation, and public finance.  

* **Master of Science in Applied Economics**, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, September 2020 – June 2024  
  * Graduate minor: Data Science.  
  * Thesis: *A Spatial Approach to Agrifood Supply Chain Structure* under the guidance of Hikaru Peterson, Professor of Applied Economics.  
  * Examined the structural dynamics of U.S. agrifood supply chains during COVID-19, using spatial regression models to measure the effect of food capacity on food flows at county levels across the supply chain.

## Research Experience

**Conservation Economist – Intern II**  
Hennepin County, Minneapolis, MN • June 2024 – Present  
* Evaluated the impact of conservation easements and programs (Green Acres, Agricultural Preserve, Rural Preserve) on property values, tax burden, and neighboring parcels.  
* Studied spillover effects on neighboring parcels, including shifts in housing values and tax liability from nearby conservation easements.  
* Simulated conservation easement scenarios to estimate fiscal impacts and illustrate tax implications for municipal budgets and finances.  
* Used R, QGIS, and ArcGIS to analyze spatial patterns in how conservation and tax policy shape local property values and public finance outcomes.  
* Analyzed costs of Best Management Practices and Nature-based Climate Solutions, including installation, maintenance, and funding options (grants, bonding, CIP, in-kind contributions).  
* Developed cost analyses and forecasts for contract specifications, including labor, equipment, and long-term maintenance, incorporating depreciation and capitalization of tools and vehicles in partnership with Hennepin County, TRPD, and Great River Greening.  
* Assisted with survey administration and data management using Survey123, including collecting responses, organizing results, and supporting integration into project workflows.  

**Graduate Research Assistant (GRA)**  
Accessibility Observatory, Minneapolis, MN • September 2022 – Present  
* Created public datasets on accessibility of transportation types (bike, car, and transit) using Pandas and SQL.  
* Developed Python pipeline taking data from AWS, cleaning it, and generating weighted average data of jobs accessible from blocks to state level within the US.  
* Built and utilized additional pipelines to generate access data for ad hoc deliverables for Met Council and state Departments of Transportation.  
* Created Rshiny application using leaflet to display national job accessibility (block group to state level) and distributed to partners.  
* Experienced with GitHub and Git commands.  

**Data Science Intern**  
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN • June 2022 – March 2024  
* Assisted the Stress Testing team in converting code from MATLAB to R to build forecasting models (VAR, Kalman Filtering) for assessing bank resiliency against macroeconomic shocks.  
* Analyzed U.S. banking conditions under the new CECL policy and presented findings to examiners and supervisors.  
* Created Rshiny applications incorporating risk models to identify bank risk levels by loan and asset types.  
* Investigated changes in rural banking quality and agricultural output in the Ninth District.  
* Built an Rshiny dashboard using U.S. Census ACS and Federal Reserve data to visualize county-level economic and banking conditions.  
* Pulled and processed data from Federal Reserve servers for models and dashboards.  
* Utilized Gitlab and Linux with the Stress Testing team.  

**Graduate Research Assistant (GRA)**  
Project: Foodshed • Agricultural Commodities  
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN • September 2020 – 2022  
* Conducted literature review for future publication.  
* Examined regional food system resiliency during the COVID-19 Pandemic.  
* Built comprehensive dataset using Census and IMPLAN data for OLS and spatial regression models in R.  

**Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
Bureau of Business and Economic Research, Duluth, MN • September 2019 – May 2020  
* Generated local economic data and performed analysis using IMPLAN, Excel, and SPSS.  
* Cleaned and interpreted survey data on Qualtrics and Excel.  
* Collaborated with fellow RAs to produce publications later published on the university website.  
* Contributed to literature review and public outreach for labor market research.
