## Anki Flashcards

During my PhD, I relied heavily on Anki flashcards as a core study tool, particularly for theory-heavy and methods-intensive material. I’m sharing a subset of the decks I built below.

### Available Decks

- **[PhD Year 1 Microeconomics Flashcards](/files/Microeconomics_anki_cards.apkg)**  
  Core microeconomic theory concepts typically covered in first-year PhD coursework.

- **[Difference-in-Differences Flashcards](/files/Difference-in-Differences.apkg)**  
  Cards focus heavily on modern DiD methods (staggered and continuous frameworks) and identification issues.

  This deck is primarily inspired by:

  - Baker, A., Callaway, B., Cunningham, S., Goodman-Bacon, A., & Sant’Anna, P. H. C. (2025).  
    *Difference-in-Differences Designs: A Practitioner’s Guide* (Version 3). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.13323

  - De Chaisemartin, C., & d’Haultfoeuille, X. (2023).  
    *Two-Way Fixed Effects and Difference-in-Differences Estimators with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Imperfect Parallel Trends*. SSRN.
